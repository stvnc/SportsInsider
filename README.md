# SportsInsider

This is SportsInsider, an application with the purpose of viewing upcoming events based on each type of sports*, team data, player data, etc*. 
This project is purely programmatic as storyboard isn't used. 

Library used: 
- **Firebase** for authentication, image storage*
- **Realm** for database
- **SDWebImage** for image related
- **DropDown** for dropdown menu

NB: * means upcoming

This project is currently under development, there's still many bugs inside this application and I will fix it ASAP.
